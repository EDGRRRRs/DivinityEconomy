<h1>📜 1.19.4 Update RC 1.0 📜</h1>
<p>We are proud to announce the release of DivinityEconomy on Modrinth, a groundbreaking Minecraft economy plugin that has been in active private use and development for over 2 years. With its well-tested features and compatibility with Minecraft versions 1.19.x, DivinityEconomy promises to deliver an unmatched in-game economy experience.</p>

<h2>🤝 Vault Integration and Compatibility 🤝</h2>
<p>Although DivinityEconomy can function independently, it has a soft dependency on the popular Vault plugin. Vault is not required for DivinityEconomy to work, but it is highly encouraged as it allows for seamless and cohesive usage between various economy plugins. By integrating with Vault, DivinityEconomy extends its compatibility and ensures a smooth experience for server owners and players alike.<br><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Vault</a></p>

<h2>💡 Optional Placeholder API Support 💡</h2>
<p>DivinityEconomy offers optional support for the Placeholder API. If server owners choose to enable this feature, they must have Placeholder API installed alongside DivinityEconomy. By supporting Placeholder API, DivinityEconomy further enhances its customization options and versatility, allowing server owners to create even more engaging and immersive economic experiences.<br><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get PlaceholderAPI</a></p>
