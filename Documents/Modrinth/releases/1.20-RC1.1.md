<h1>🚀 DivinityEconomy 1.20 - The Experience Update 🚀</h1>

<p>Hello Minecraft enthusiasts! 😄 We're absolutely thrilled to announce the latest update to our revolutionary DivinityEconomy plugin, the <strong>Experience Update</strong>. This update introduces a host of changes and improvements, making your in-game economy experience even more immersive and exciting! Let's dive into the details. 🎉</p>


<h2>🆕 What's New? 🆕</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    <h4>Updated to Minecraft 1.20 (RC1.0)</h4>
    <p>We have updated the DivinityEconomy plugin to support the latest version of Minecraft, 1.20, keeping up with the most recent advancements in the Minecraft server world. We've updated materials, potions, entities and enchantments to 1.20. Everything is now in sync with the latest Minecraft version. 🎮</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Experience Trading (RC1.0)</h4>
    <p>The new /xpsell and /xpbuy commands allow you to sell and buy experience. It's called the Experience Update for a reason! 🎓</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Enchantment Trading (RC1.0)</h4>
    <p>You can now buy and sell enchantments directly to and from books. It's an enchanting improvement, wouldn't you agree? ✨</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Enhanced Selling Mechanics (RC1.0)</h4>
    <p>Now, when selling items, enchanted items are skipped! This means if you're selling a batch of items, those pesky enchanted ones won't block the sale of your other items. No more interruptions to your selling spree! 👌</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>"Max" Buying Option (RC1.0)</h4>
    <p>The buy command now accepts "max" as a purchasing amount. Want to buy as much as possible? Just type "max" and you're good to go! 🙌</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>✍️ Tweaks ✍️</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    <h4>Scaling Changes (RC1.0)</h4>
    <p>We have drastically reduced the scaling applied to transactions. This means that exchanged values are much less, making it easier to integrate with your existing plugins. We reccommend taking caution when adding this plugin to your server, as it may affect your market.</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Easy Enchant Buying and Selling (RC1.0)</h4>
    <p>The /Ebuy and /Esell commands no longer explicitly require a quantity. If you don't specify a quantity, it will simply default to 1. Handy, isn't it? 🛒</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Improved Tooltips (RC1.0)</h4>
    <p>The tooltips for the /ebuy and /esell commands have been given a polish. Clearer and more detailed, they'll make your enchanting transactions smoother than ever. 💡</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Value Information with Max Buying/Selling (RC1.0)</h4>
    <p>Using /Sell or /buy with "max" will now provide value information. More information means smarter trading! 💼</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Updated Experience Scaling and Base Quantities (RC1.1)</h4>
    <p>We've updated the default experience market scaling and base quantity, as experience was previously extremely over-valued, this has been rectified.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ Fixes 🛠️</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    <h4>Item Count Storage (RC1.0)</h4>
    <p>We've switched the storage of item counts from int to long. This resolves any division issues with large numbers of items in the market. No more maths headaches! 🧮</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Fixed Default Buy/Sell Scaling (RC1.0)</h4>
    <p>We've patched up the default buy/sell scaling in the configuration. Just another tweak to improve your experience. 🔧</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Enchanted Items Bug Fix (RC1.1)</h4>
    <p>We've fixed an issue with /sellall and /sell preventing the sale of items if enchanted items were in your inventory.</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Fixed Missing Permissions For Experience Commands In Plugin.yml (RC1.1)</h4>
    <p>We've fixed an issue with missing permission nodes for the /xpbuy and /xpsell command.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>🤝 Vault Integration and Compatibility 🤝</h2>
<p>Although DivinityEconomy can function independently, it has a soft dependency on the popular Vault plugin. Vault is not required for DivinityEconomy to work, but it is highly encouraged as it allows for seamless and cohesive usage between various economy plugins. By integrating with Vault, DivinityEconomy extends its compatibility and ensures a smooth experience for server owners and players alike.<br><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Vault</a></p>

<h2>💡 Optional Placeholder API Support 💡</h2>
<p>DivinityEconomy offers optional support for the Placeholder API. If server owners choose to enable this feature, they must have Placeholder API installed alongside DivinityEconomy. By supporting Placeholder API, DivinityEconomy further enhances its customization options and versatility, allowing server owners to create even more engaging and immersive economic experiences.<br><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get PlaceholderAPI</a></p>

<p>With its robust and matured features, DivinityEconomy stands out as a top-tier Minecraft economy plugin. As the plugin makes its official debut on Modrinth, Minecraft server owners and players can now enjoy an unparalleled in-game economy experience backed by years of development and refinement. Don't miss out on the opportunity to elevate your Minecraft server with DivinityEconomy.</p>
