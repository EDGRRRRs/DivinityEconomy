<h1>🚀 DivinityEconomy 1.20 - The Help Update (RC2.0) 🚀</h1>
<p>Hello Minecraft aficionados! 😄 We're excited to bring you the next round of updates to our innovative DivinityEconomy plugin, the <strong>Help Update RC2.0</strong>. This version expands on the previous improvements, introducing an enhanced help system, new chat colours for better command readability, more helpful error messages, and much more. Let's take a deep dive into this exciting update. 🎉</p>
<h2>🆕 What's New? 🆕</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    <h4>Overhauled Help System (RC2.0)</h4>
    <p>We have completely revamped our help system to make it easier for you to find the commands you need. Here is the new command structure: 
        <ul>
        <li><code>/ehelp <command></code> - Returns the help for that command.</li>
        <li><code>/ehelp <term> <page number></code> - A comprehensive search function to find the command you're looking for based on the given search term. The page number is optional.</li>
        <li><code>/ehelp <page number></code> - Lists all commands by page number.</li>
        </ul>
    This way, you will never feel lost while using our plugin. 🗺️</p>
