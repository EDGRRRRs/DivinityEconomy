<h2>💾 Vault Dependency 💾</h2>
<p>DivinityEconomy is reliant on the renowned plugin Vault. Vault is a necessity for DivinityEconomy's functionality, enabling seamless integration amongst various economy plugins 🔁<br><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acquire Vault Here 📥</a></p>
<h2>🔌 Placeholder API Note 🔌</h2>
<p>Traditionally, DivinityEconomy includes Placeholder API variables; however, in the current release, this feature is missing due to lack of support from Placeholder API in version 1.20.6. If server owners elect to enable this feature, they must install Placeholder API alongside DivinityEconomy. The support for Placeholder API would have extended DivinityEconomy's customization possibilities and versatility, allowing server owners to develop even more captivating and immersive economic experiences. Unfortunately, the absence of this feature in the current release limits these customization options.</p>
