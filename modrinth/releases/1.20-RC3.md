<h1>üöÄ DivinityEconomy 1.20 - The Complete Overhaul (RC3.0) üöÄ</h1>
<p>Hello Minecraft aficionados! üòÑ We're excited to bring you the next round of updates to our innovative DivinityEconomy plugin, the <strong>Overhaul Update RC3.0</strong>.

Let's take a deep dive into this exciting update. üéâ</p>
<h2>üÜï What's New? üÜï</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    <h4>Vault Dependency</h4>
    <p>DivinityEconomy is now dependent on the popular plugin Vault. Vault is required for DivinityEconomy to work, it allows for seamless and cohesive usage between various economy plugins.<br><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Vault</a></p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>Esellall</h4>
    <p>This amazing new commands adds the ability for users to sell all enchants in their inventory. It works like /sellall, whereby it accepts a whitelist or a blacklist of items to sell from.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>Named / Lored Items</h4>
    <p>We have added the ability to skip both named and lored items, in the plugin config.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>New Placeholders</h4>
    <p>We have added a few new placeholders, including the ability to get the value of exp points, both buying and selling.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>New Items</h4>
    <p>We have added values and enabled the following items:</p>
    <ul>
        - Decorated Pottery<br>
        - Brush<br>
        - Pitcher Flower & Buds<br>
        - Pink Petals<br>
        - Piglin Head<br>
        - Relic Music Disc<br>
        - New Infested Blocks<br>
        - Chiseled Bookshelf<br>
        - Calibrated Sculk Sensor<br>
        - Pottery Sherds<br>
        - All Bamboo Blocks<br>
        - Torch Flower & Seeds <br>
        - Armour Trim Templates<br>
        - All Hanging-Sign Blocks<br>
        - All Cherry Tree Blocks<br>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>As well as adding the following items to the default blacklist:</p>
    <ul>
        - All 1.20 Spawn Eggs<br>
        - All 1.20 Spawners<br>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Finally, we have removed certain broken potion types.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>Plugin Speedup</h4>
    <p>We've spent alot of time improving algorithms and functions to be considerably faster.</p>
    <p>We've also introduced LRU Caching algorithms to 'searchable' aspects of the plugin to speed up the tab completion aspect of the plugin.
    <p>Furthermore, We've also introduced asynchronous caching algorithms that reduce plugin slowdown when dependant on slow functions, this was especially noticeable for baltop and searching players.</p> 
    <p>Most asynchronous tasks are also run directly from startup, meaning that you no longer need to wait for certain features, like baltop, to be shown on plugin startup.</p>
    <br>    
    <p>This greatly improves plugin speed when searching through materials, enchants, potions, players and more!</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>Improved Error & Success Messages</h4>
    <p>We've improved many messages across the plugin to be more accurate, beautiful and descriptive.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>Vault Banking</h4>
    <p>We've introduced vault banking, meaning DivinityEconomy now supports Vault-Compatible banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>Backups</h4>
    <p>We've introduced player and bank file backups, incase the primary file fails to save or becomes corrupted, a backup will automatically be loaded (if it exists).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>‚úçÔ∏è Tweaks ‚úçÔ∏è</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    <h4>Optimised Save Files</h4>
    <p>We've optimised player save files to not include ridiculously large decimal values.</p>
    <p>We've also removed player balance logs from save files, improving save time and plugin size.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>Vault & PlaceholderAPI</h4>
    <p>We've updated our internal logic so that Vault is now properly supported, and PlaceholderAPI as been fixed.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Fixes üõ†Ô∏è</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    <h4>Duplicate Help Messages</h4>
    <p>We've fixed a bug that caused duplicate help messages to be shown when searching the help system.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>Fixed Balance Rounding</h4>
    <p>We've fixed a bug that caused player balances to be rounded up, this often meant if you tried to send all of your balance, you'd get an overdraft error, no more!</p>
</li>
</ul>
