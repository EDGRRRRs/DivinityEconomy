Let's delve further into this thrilling update 🏁</p>
<h2>🌟 What's New? 🌟</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    <h3>💾 Vault Dependency 💾</h3>
    <p>DivinityEconomy now relies on the widely adopted plugin, Vault. A requirement for DivinityEconomy's functionality, Vault fosters a seamless integration with various economy plugins 🔁<br><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acquire Vault Here 📥</a></p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3>📦 Esellall 📦</h3>
    <p>This remarkable new command permits users to vend all enchantments from their inventory. It operates akin to /sellall, accepting either a whitelist or a blacklist of items to vend from 📋.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3>🏷️ Named/Lored Items 🏷️</h3>
    <p>We've introduced the capability to omit both named and lored items in the plugin configuration 🔧.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3>💬 New Placeholders 💬</h3>
    <p>We've incorporated a few new placeholders, inclusive of the ability to determine the value of experience points, for both buying and selling 💸.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3>🔓 New Items 🔓</h3>
    <p>We've ascribed values to and enabled the following items 📦:</p>
    <ul>
        - Decorated Pottery 🏺<br>
        - Brush 🖌️<br>
        - Pitcher Flower & Buds 🌺<br>
        - Pink Petals 🌸<br>
        - Piglin Head 🐷<br>
        - Relic Music Disc 🎵<br>
        - New Infested Blocks 🐜<br>
        - Chiseled Bookshelf 📚<br>
        - Calibrated Sculk Sensor 📡<br>
        - Pottery Sherds 🏺<br>
        - All Bamboo Blocks 🎍<br>
        - Torch Flower & Seeds 🌻<br>
        - Armour Trim Templates 🛡️<br>
        - All Hanging-Sign Blocks 🪧<br>
        - All Cherry Tree Blocks 🌳<br>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>In addition, we've added the following items to the default blacklist 🚫:</p>
    <ul>
        - All 1.20 Spawn Eggs 🥚<br>
        - All 1.20 Spawners 💥<br>
    </ul>
    <br>

</li>
<li>
    <h3>🚀 Plugin Acceleration 🚀</h3>
    <p>We've dedicated considerable time to enhancing the algorithms and functions for increased speed 🏎️.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, we've implemented LRU Caching algorithms to 'searchable' components of the plugin to expedite the tab completion aspect ✔️.</p>
    <p>We've also incorporated asynchronous caching algorithms to minimise plugin slowdown when reliant on slower functions. This improvement was particularly evident for baltop and player searching functions 🕵️‍♂️.</p>
    <p>Most asynchronous tasks initiate directly from startup, implying that the waiting period for certain features, like baltop, to appear on plugin startup has been eliminated ⏱️.</p>
    <br>    
    <p>This significantly improves plugin speed when searching through materials, enchantments, potions, players and more 🔍.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3>👍 Enhanced Error & Success Messages 👍</h3>
    <p>We've upgraded numerous messages throughout the plugin to be more precise, visually appealing, and descriptive 💬.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3>💰 Vault Banking 💰</h3>
    <p>We've introduced vault banking, implying that DivinityEconomy now supports Vault-Compatible banks 🏦.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3>💾 Backups 💾</h3>
    <p>We've incorporated player and bank file backups. In case the primary file fails to save or becomes corrupted, a backup will automatically load (if available) 🔁.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>🔧 Modifications 🔧</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    <h3>🚀 Optimised Save Files 🚀</h3>
    <p>We've optimised player save files to exclude excessively large decimal values. Additionally, we've removed player balance logs from save files, thereby improving save time and reducing plugin size 💾.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3>💼 Vault & PlaceholderAPI 💼</h3>
    <p>We've updated our internal logic to fully support Vault, and we've rectified PlaceholderAPI 🛠️.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>🐞 Bug Fixes 🐞</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    <h3>🔁 Duplicate Help Messages 🔁</h3>
    <p>We've remedied a bug that caused repetitive help messages to be displayed when utilising the help system 🛠️.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3>🔄 Fixed Balance Rounding 🔄</h3>
    <p>We've resolved a bug that resulted in player balances being rounded up. This often led to an overdraft error when trying to transfer the entire balance. This will no longer occur 🛠️.</p>
</li>
</ul>
